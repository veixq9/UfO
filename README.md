here i present some examples to show what is possible

tis indexes to certain politico-analytic works:

https://veixq9.github.io/indexes/public/indexes/index.html

as you can see the website is hosted on github.io.

here is the code to the 'index' website which lives on github.com:
https://github.com/veixq9/indexes

'github' itself implements the 'git' protocol, which is a system for managing data versioning.

i suggest looking into the following for online management of group discussions & chats:
https://revolt.chat/
which is an open-source alternative to more widely known 'discord.app'

'gitter', 'zulip', 'matrix', ... for public and private chatting, bulletins, announcements, ...
https://gitter.im/


schliessfaecher and flying donuts?!


https://convex.world/  may give y'all an idea of how one may build and run a whole government together with a legal system, legal tender tokens, acts, inflationary currency, novel taxation contracts, voting mechanisms, registry systems, ..., on a live replicable system.

for instance issuance of NFTs (non-fungible tokens) for multiple purposes (promoting artists, raising awareness through aesthetically transduced forms, issuance of tickets & memoribilia, keeping track of a log of history of the org's activities...)
