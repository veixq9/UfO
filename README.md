tis indexes to certain politico-analytic works:

https://veixq9.github.io/indexes/public/indexes/index.html

as you can see the website is hosted on github.io.

here is the code to the 'index' website which lives on github.com:
https://github.com/veixq9/indexes

'github' itself implements the 'git' protocol, which is a system for managing data versioning.

i suggest looking into the following for online management of group discussions & chats:
https://revolt.chat/
which is an open-source alternative to more widely known 'discord.app'
https://gitter.im/
